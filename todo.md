# BEFORE BETA
- Notifications for social actions
- Implement 'user_updated' event for other users (probably will just use some field filtering for sensitive fields)
- Account to bot migration (should be easy)
- User/chat icon uploads (and /uploads API) (should be easy, apart from converting and compressing)
- Post/comment/message masquerading (easy, just waiting on image uploads)
- Background worker thing to manage and cleanup stuff
- Account exports and deletions

# DURING BETA
- OAuth2
- Administration and moderation API
- MFA with already logged in clients
